## What is this project about?
This project analyses customers based on factors such as marriage, parenthood, income, and purchasing habits. From the analysis, we derive models which can predict whether a customer is likely to spend more based on their income, or whether a customer who prefers shopping on the web is a parent or not.

## Problem Definition
* Does the number of children a customer have affect which channel (i.e. web, catalog, physical store) they shop at? How much do they spend on each product category?
* How can a company know whether a customer who visits their web store a certain number of times is a parent?

## Conclusion
* Customers who have more family members (i.e. more children) spent less on different channels.
* Customers who have children spend less on each category of products, as spending on each category has a moderately negative relationship with whether they have children.
* Customers who have children continue to purchase from the web store, but reduce their purchases from the catalog and physical stores.
* Whether or not a customer has children can be predicted based on the number of web store visits a month.
